  It's crab season here in the San Francisco bay area.  Heap and heaps
  of luscious Dungeness crabs are showing up all over the place.
  Steamed or live, take your pick!  I was in Oakland's Chinatown last
  weekend shopping at the Sam Yick gorcery and saw a couple of boxes of
  still- kicking Blue crabs for a buck seventy-nine a pound.  Good
  eatin' ahead!
  
  Kill and clean the crab.  Place it, top shell down, on a heat-
  resistant plate.  Scatter the onion, ginger and wine on top of the
  crab. Put the crab and plate into a preheated steamer. steam over
  high heat for 15 minutes. Remove and cool.
  
  Disjoint and crack the crab and arrange on a platter.  Dip the meat
  into the dipping sauce and eat with green onions and ginger.  Use the
  tip of the leg to dig out the meat.
  
  Serves 2 as a light meal.

GINGER, GREEN ONION and VINEGAR DIPPING SAUCE: 

  Scatter green onions in a shallow saucer.  Top with the shredded 
  ginger. Sprinkle sugar and salt evenly over the ginger.  
  Pour the vinegar over the ginger. Heat the oil until it's hot 
  but not smoking, and pour it over the mixture.
  It should sizzle lightly.  If it is too hot, let it cool.
  
  Makes about 2/3 cup.
